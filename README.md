# Just a simple Vue app 

## Overview

This app provides simple interafce made partly with [Bootstrap Vue](https://bootstrap-vue.org/) and allows to view, add, remove and edit cars and users within the tables. Backend is made using [Java Spring](https://spring.io/). This app was done for the class purposes, but requirements were to use plain JS, but I wanted to step a bit further and there it is!
